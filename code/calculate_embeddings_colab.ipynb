    "# Parliamentary Speech Processing Pipeline - Multi-Language Support\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a complete pipeline for processing parliamentary speeches in multiple languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup & Configuration** - Google Colab setup and imports\n",
    "2. **Core Functions** - Embedding and segmentation functions (language-agnostic)\n",
    "3. **Data Processing** - Configurable pipeline for any language\n",
    "4. **Language-Specific Execution** - Run pipeline for English, German, or other languages\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features:\n",
    "- **Multi-language support**: English, German (easily extensible)\n",
    "- **Dual embedding strategy**: Speech-level + Segment-level\n",
    "- **Smart segmentation**: Agenda-aware boundary detection\n",
    "- **GPU optimization**: A100 optimized with checkpointing"
